## view

![sfeir-icons big](plus-circle) Default materialization in dbt. Good choice for low compute models like renaming or recasting.

![sfeir-icons big](cpu) Does not use storage in your warehouse, but uses compute time every time you read from it. Beware of stacking too many views on top of each others.

![sfeir-icons big](watch) Very fast to create at build time. Data may vary each time you read from a view.

## table

![sfeir-icons big](clock) Very fast to query, but can be long to (re)create at each run.

![sfeir-icons big](git-commit) Must be refreshed to include updates to underlying sources.

![sfeir-icons big](refresh-cw) Preferred choice for models exposed as data products or use cases, and models used as reference by many other models.

## ephemeral

![sfeir-icons big](plus-circle) Creates a CTE that is replaced in the models querying this table.

![sfeir-icons big](cpu) Used for intermediate calculations or as intermediate areas in complex data transformations.

![sfeir-icons big](watch) Offers a flexible and efficient way to manage temporary data transformations and calculations within your dbt workflows.
