# Reusable code with macros

Macros are reusable blocks of code that can be defined and invoked within your _dbt_ project.

<br/>

* Code Reusability: provides consistency and reduce duplication
* Encapsulation of Logic: improve readability
* Dynamic SQL generation: SQL queries based on provided parameters or conditions
* Parameterization: use of parameters brings flexibility
* Modularity: macros can be organized into modules or files

# Declaring macros

Macros are `SQL` files using a custom jinja-like syntax, kept in the `macros` directory and subdirectories.

If you have to repeat code logic or formulas more than once: use a macro.

`/macros/formulas/turnover.sql`
```sql[]
{% macro turnover() %}
    (base_price * quantity - rebate)
{% endmacro %}

{% macro raw_turnover() %}
    (base_price * quantity)
{% endmacro %}
```

Notes:
* You can declare more than one macro in each file -- use it to regroup logic

# Using macros

Using macros in your models is as simple as using variables.

The macro placeholders will be replaced by the generated SQL code at compilation time.

`models/sales.sql`
```sql[]
SELECT
  order_id
  , customer_id
  , order_date
  , {{ turnover() }} AS turnover  -- Macro is used here
FROM {{ ref("sales") }}
WHERE TRUE
  {{ order_completed() }} -- Potential complex logic here
```

Notes:
* Remember you can always use dbt compile to see the generated SQL.
* Use {%- (with dashes) to control the output

# Using arguments in macros

You can create more complex logic in a single macro using arguments.

`/macros/formulas/turnover.sql`
```sql[]
{% macro turnover(_include_rebate) %}
    (
      base_price * quantity
      {% if _include_rebate %}
      - rebate
      {% endif %} 
    )
{% endmacro %}
```

`models/sales.sql`
```sql[]
SELECT
  *
  , {{ turnover(true) }} AS turnover
FROM {{ ref("sales") }}
```

# Documenting macros

Documenting macros is done using a `YAML` file:
* include a global description of the macro
* add a description of each argument of the macro

<br/>

```yaml[]
macros:
  - name: i18n_compatible_name
    description: "Compute a international-compatible name from a list of fields."
  - name: turnover
    description: Compute turnover for each line in sales
    arguments:
        - name: _include_rebate
          type: bool
          description: Include rebate amount in the computation or not
```

Notes:
* It's a good practice to document macros !
* Declaring macros is optionnal, but it's always better to implicitely declare what you build
